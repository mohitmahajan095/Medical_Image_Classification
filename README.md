# Medical_Image_Classification
This project leverages Google Teachable Machine to train a deep learning model for classifying images into MRI, CT, X-Ray, and non-medical image. The model is saved as a .h5 file and integrated into a Streamlit web app, enabling users to upload images for instant classification. It serves both educational and practical purposes in medical imaging.
